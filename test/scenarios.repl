;; TODO tests:
;; - Pointing to nested hypertext ($sq.0.0).
;; - Unlocking a grandparent.
;; - Reachability. Draw a tree and deduce reachability test cases from it.
;; - Add assertions for the invariants, then run random tests.
;; - Multiple pointers at the same answer.
;; - Multiple pointers with the same target in one hypertext.
;; - Test several scenarios without reset.
