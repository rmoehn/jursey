;;;;;; Application of reflection: Ask for clarification of a question

;; Look at the argument of the check-diff! calls to see what the workspace
;; looks like at that point. This way you don't necessarly have to run the
;; commands in your own REPL.

;; For another example of clarification, see clarification-airplane.repl. It
;; points out a problem with non-unified pointers.
